This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: unhandled exceptions within request handlers. The `bug.js` file shows a server that crashes if there is an error processing a request.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling using a `try...catch` block. This prevents the server from crashing and allows for graceful error handling.
